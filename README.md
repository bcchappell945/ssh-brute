# Usage
This Python script is designed exclusively for authorized security testing and penetration testing purposes to assess the strength of SSH configurations, and should only be used with explicit permission from the system owner; any unauthorized or illegal use for malicious hacking attempts is strictly prohibited and may result in severe legal consequences. To use this tool, run `python3 ssh-brute.py`
